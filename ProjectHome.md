## Legal issues ##

Before we can accept a patch from you (if you are not a Google employee), you must sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). The CLA protects you and us.

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html).  Individual CLAs can be signed electronically.
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html).

The Google CLA is based on Apache's.  Note that unlike some projects (notably GNU projects), we do _not_ require a transfer of copyright.  You still own the patch.

Sadly, our lawyers say that even the smallest patch needs a CLA.
